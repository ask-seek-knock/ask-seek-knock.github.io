Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many people have been affected in various ways.
In hospital, some patients failed to survived from the virus, leaving endless
grief to their families. Others who are free from the virus physically alse
feel the ubiquitous impact.
I was laid off in August 2020, and have been jobless for over 6 months. I am
eligible for the unemployment benefits, and there is about 1700 CNY (264 USD)
per month for 1 year. After some idle time, I started considering my future, or
more concretely, my marriage, my life when I grow old. How could I support my
parents when they are older? I can't help feeling a stab of powerlessness.

On the same time, however, I am responsible to do something, and I know what it
is. I have to escape from Hawaii, from the xxp, and only in this way can I
revive to support myself, my wife, my families. Without getting away from their
reins, nothing could be done.
